# Welcome to My AI Journey Blog! 🎉🤖✨

## About Me 💁‍♀️  
Hi there! I’m *KatPrincess* 👑 (no, I don’t live in a castle 🏰… yet). I have a **Bachelor's in Psychology 🧠** and work as a **QA Automation Engineer 🛠️**, where I spend my days squashing bugs 🐛 and automating all the things.  

For most of my life, *AI and artificial intelligence* sounded like sci-fi mumbo jumbo 🛸, and I couldn’t care less about it. BUT THEN… **ChatGPT 🧙‍♂️✨** and **MidJourney 🎨🤯** entered the scene, and suddenly, I was like, “Oh wow, this is kinda cool. Maybe I should actually *learn* this stuff.”  

And that’s how this blog was born! 💡

## What’s This Blog About? 📚✍️  
This is my **personal vent book**, where I’ll be sharing:  
- 💡 *Everything I’ve learned about AI so far* (including moments of sheer genius and utter confusion).  
- 🛠️ *Challenges I’ve faced* (spoiler alert: there are lots).  
- 🎉 *Wins that make me want to throw a little dance party 💃.*  
- 🧠 *Deep dives into AI concepts that *finally* clicked for me.*  

I’m currently taking the **"Practical Deep Learning for Coders 2022"** course, and this blog is my way of documenting the ride 🚀. Think of it as my AI diary 📔 but with less drama and more nerdy excitement.
